  Dear Colleague, Please note carefully that these antibiograms only reflect the
  testing results for the year and locales noted. You have to know how to
  interpret the data here and you have to know how to use antibiogram
  information when making clinical care decisions. This app is no substitute for
  knowledge, training, and experience treating infections. The app is merely a
  quick reference for commonly used information to assist local clinicians.
  Remember, always do your own thinking.
